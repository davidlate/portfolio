            <h3>About this Section</h3>
            <p>
               This section offers some more insight into the various engineering skills I've built up over the years.  
               I look forward to continuing to do learn and grow in my next opportunity.

            <h3>Solidworks Skills</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><h4>CAD Modelling and Part Design</h4>
                <p>I have 3+ years experience using Solidworks for CAD modelling, and can model at a professional level, including but not limited to part and mult-part assembly design and sheet metal.
                    <br><br> In creating designs I pay heavy attention to tolerance stackups between assembly parts, which can often become complicated when factoring in expected thermal expansion.  
                    <br><br>   In selecting materials I've
                    considered cost, manufacturability, dimensional stability, rigidity, strength, density, UV resistance, temperature resistance, thermal expansion,
                    thermal conductivity, visual appearance, porosity and susceptibity to expansion when wet, corrosion resistance, and chemical compatibility with other materials in the assembly.
                    </li>
                </p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>Drawings using GD&T</h4>
                <p>I am proficient using GD&T following ASME Y14.5, and have primarily used it for flatness, parallelism, press-fits, and true positioning of holes. <br><br>
                    It's useful for using alignment hardware to create precise assembly fits and for ensuring proper fluid sealing and heat transfer without "overspecifying" tolerances. <br><br>
                    I've found the <a class="linked" href="https://www.sae.org/publications/books/content/pd0219100-pg01/">SAE GD&T Pocket Guide</a> is a very useful reference - particularly for understand datum assignments
                    and the meanings behind tolerance callouts (for example: how a ⌀.014" true position callout can end up being as tight as +/-.005", and how to understand MMC callouts), although many of the examples in the book would only be used in very specific applications. <br><br>
                    In most all cases, it's best to talk with the vendor to find out their preference, oftentimes I have been surprised with the capabilities they've offered as being easy, such as 5-axis machining, as technology has advanced over the years.
                </p>
            </li>

                <li><h4>FEA Analysis</h4>
                <p>I've used Solidworks for static FEA analyses in both thermal and structural applications.  From testing I've learned that seemingly simple fixturing assumptions
                    can have significant effects on the result which may or may not be correct. <br><br> I've gone through and physically tested designs influenced by the FEA and been able to
                    see when those assumptions were accurate and when they needed to be adjusted.

            <h3>Design for Manufacturing</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><h4>CNC Machining</h4>
                <p>Through my work experiences I've designed a number of parts to be machined by both CNC mills and lathes. <br><br> These have been made by quick-turn suppliers, local vendors, myself, and occasionally other in-house employees.
                    I have a solid understanding of the techniques required, including but not limited to: fixturability, leaving in tool radii for endmills, reasonable tolerances, and keeping an eye on acceptable l/d ratios.
                    I've incorporated techniques such as reaming and press-fit alignment hardware.

                    <br> <br>
                    I've learned inspecting fabricated parts in-house upon arrival is very important, especially since many vendors will only fully inspect the first article if not otherwise specified.
                </p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>Sheet Metal</h4>
                <p>I've designed and tested a few parts out of sheet metal.  The main considerations I follow are to keep an eye on minimum bend radii, 
                    and the tolerancing stackups between holes and other features.  K-factors are one way to measure bend radii, though some suppliers will have a
                    fixed recommendation that works with their tools, and others will specify the radius as a multiple of material thickness. <br><br>
                    Generally, tolerancing between parts on the same piece can be quite good, but features with bends between them can be off by as much as +/- .030", necessitating
                    workarounds such as using slots instead of holes.  <br><br>
                    Sheet metal is also nice because of ease of incorporating PEM inserts
                </p></li>
                <li><h4>Injection Molding</h4>
                <p>I've become familiar with the principles of injection molding design, but due to the high cost of soft- and hard-tooling I have not created a design to be injection molded yet. <br><br>
                    The main considerations I'm aware of are to maintain a consistent nominal wall thickness throughout the entire part, incorporate features to allow for endmill radii when fabricating the molds,
                    incorporating a 3-4° draft angle on all vertical faces, and being mindful of where the injection points may be so that the plastic doesn't cool down before fully filling the mold.
