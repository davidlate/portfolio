            <h3>About this Section</h3>
            <p>
               This section offers some more insight into the various engineering skills I've built up over the years.  
               I look forward to continuing to do learn and grow in my next opportunity.

        <section class="Solidworks part" id="#solidworks">
            <h3>Solidworks Skills</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><h4>CAD Modelling and Part Design</h4>
                <p>I have 3+ years experience using Solidworks for CAD modelling, and can model at a professional level, including but not limited to part and mult-part assembly design and sheet metal.
                    <br><br> In creating designs I pay heavy attention to tolerance stackups between assembly parts, which can often become complicated when factoring in expected thermal expansion.  
                    <br><br>   In selecting materials I've
                    considered cost, manufacturability, dimensional stability, rigidity, strength, density, UV resistance, temperature resistance, thermal expansion,
                    thermal conductivity, visual appearance, porosity and susceptibity to expansion when wet, corrosion resistance, and chemical compatibility with other materials in the assembly.
                    </li>
                </p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>Drawings using GD&T</h4>
                <p>I am proficient using GD&T following ASME Y14.5, and have primarily used it for flatness, parallelism, press-fits, and true positioning of holes. <br><br>
                    It's useful for using alignment hardware to create precise assembly fits and for ensuring proper fluid sealing and heat transfer without "overspecifying" tolerances. <br><br>
                    I've found the <a class="linked" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sae.org/publications/books/content/pd0219100-pg01/" >SAE GD&T Pocket Guide</a> is a very useful reference - particularly for understand datum assignments
                    and the meanings behind tolerance callouts (for example: how a ⌀.014" true position callout can end up being as tight as +/-.005", and how to understand MMC callouts), although many of the examples in the book would only be used in very specific applications. <br><br>
                    In most all cases, it's best to talk with the vendor to find out their preference, oftentimes I have been surprised with the capabilities they've offered as being easy, such as 5-axis machining, as technology has advanced over the years. <br>
                    The <a class="linked" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://books.industrialpress.com/9780831130923/machinerys-handbook-large-print/">Machinery's Handbook</a> also has some nice examples of GD&T applications.
                </p>
            </li>

                <li><h4>FEA Analysis</h4>
                <p>I've used Solidworks for static FEA analyses in both thermal and structural applications.  From testing I've learned that seemingly simple fixturing assumptions
                    can have significant effects on the result which may or may not be correct. <br><br> I've gone through and physically tested designs influenced by the FEA and been able to
                    see when those assumptions were accurate and when they needed to be adjusted.

            <h3>Design for Manufacturing</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><h4>CNC Machining</h4>
                <p>Through my work experiences I've designed a large number of parts to be machined by both CNC mills and lathes. <br><br> These have been made by quick-turn suppliers, local vendors, myself, and occasionally other in-house employees.
                    I have a solid understanding of the techniques required, including but not limited to: fixturability, leaving in tool radii for endmills, reasonable tolerances, and keeping an eye on acceptable l/d ratios.
                    I've incorporated techniques such as reaming and press-fit alignment hardware.

                    <br> <br>
                    I've learned inspecting fabricated parts in-house upon arrival is very important, especially since many vendors will only fully inspect the first article if not otherwise specified.
                </p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>Sheet Metal</h4>
                <p>I've designed and tested parts using sheet metal.  The main considerations I follow are to keep an eye on minimum bend radii, 
                    and the tolerancing stackups between holes and other features.  K-factors are one way to measure bend radii, though some suppliers will have a
                    fixed recommendation that works with their tools, and others will specify the radius as a multiple of material thickness. <br><br>
                    Generally, tolerancing between parts on the same piece can be quite good, but features with bends between them can be off by as much as +/- .030", necessitating
                    workarounds such as using slots instead of holes.  <br><br>
                    Sheet metal is also nice because of ease of incorporating PEM inserts
                </p></li>
                <li><h4>Injection Molding</h4>
                <p>I've become familiar with the principles of injection molding design, but due to the high cost of soft- and hard-tooling I have not created a design to be injection molded yet. <br><br>
                    The main considerations I'm aware of are to maintain a consistent nominal wall thickness throughout the entire part, incorporate features to allow for endmill radii when fabricating the molds,
                    incorporating a 3-4° draft angle on all vertical faces, and being mindful of where the injection points may be so that the plastic doesn't cool down before fully filling the mold.
                </p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>Additive Manufacturing / 3D Printing Metal & Plastic</h4>
                <p>I've prototyped extensively using resin SLA 3D printers, which are very nice for complex geometries but struggle with respect to dimensional stability and print times. <br><br> In particular they
                    can have a tendency to warp toward the "supported" side while curing and they struggle with internal cavities where fluid is unable to drain during printing. Care must be taken to orient the most critical features correctly on the build platform to maximize chances for a
                    successful part.<br><br>
                I've also used 3D printed metal for rapid prototyping; this enables quick production of very complex geometries but requires certain considerations to be used effectively.  In particular, 
                it leaves a very rough surface finish which often requires post-machining, but the rough surfaces don't provide good reference surfaces to fixture and align the post-machining operation. <br><br>
                Additionally, there can be voids hidden in the material, the complex geometries make complete inspection difficult, and there may be leftover un-sintered powder hidden in cavities.  Additionally,
                there are fewer resources available for the material properties of 3D printed metal - including strength, thermal conductivity, and material compatibility; and the properties that are available must be taken with a grain of salt as the 3D printed materials are anisotropic.

            <h3>Microcontrollers and Automation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><h4>Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone</h4>
                <p>
                    I've been experimenting with small Single-Board computers like the Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone since sophomore year in college.  A BeagleBone is similar to a Raspberry Pi, but is
                    readily available and doesn't suffer from the Pi's supply chain issues.  The catch is that BeagleBones are much slower, often don't include
                    Wi-Fi functionality, and mainly work through just a command-line interface (the GUI is not great, in my opinion). Some things I have done with these devices include:</p>
                    <ul class="bullet">

                        <li>
                            <p>Reading and recording data from multiple sensors, and using data to automatically control hardware, with the help of a LabJack device (detailed further in following sections).</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Connecting and reading data over SSH.  I like the <a class="linked" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/">screen</a> 
                                application that maintains a single SSH session even if the original connection is disconnected so long as the Pi remains on, and can be configured to run automatically on startup.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Driving servos and stepper motors using PWM hardware pins as part of my college capstone.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Driving gear motors and recording their position using rotary encoders.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Running python scripts on startup using crontab, and incorporating simple linux scripts to automatically mount and unmount USB drives and SD cards on startup or upon a button push.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Re-soldering the mini-USB socket back onto a Raspberry Pi.</p>
                        </li>


                    </ul>
            
                <p>In my opinion, these computers are limited because they don't use a Real-Time Operating System, and as such your programs may be 
                    somewhat subject to the whims of the Linux operating system, interrupting their timing.  This is usually not an issue, but can make it difficult to run programs on startup and 
                    maintain precise fixed sampling intervals without external hardware to help.  In my opinion most setups function much better when the brunt of the
                    sampling is dependent on a microcontroller such as an Arduino or a DAQ such as a LabJack, with the Raspberry Pi being used to record the data
                    and access the internet.
                </p>
                <p><br>
                    In my opinion these devices would hugely benefit from a Real-Time Clock addition such as <a class="linked" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3386">this</a>,
                    which I look forward to trying.</p>

                </li>
                <li><h4>Arduino</h4>
                <p>I've used Arduino in school and for personal projects. I like them for their simplicity (any program you write runs immediately on startup), 
                    their use of 5V logic (as opposed to 3.3V for the Raspberry Pi), and the fact that they have built-in Analog IO channels in addition to the Digital IO.
                    I've used Arduino with C++ to read sensors including an ultrasonic distance sensor and control motors through a motor controller circuit. <br><br></p>
                <p>In the future, I would be interested to create a custom PCB and incorporate the Arduino microcontroller without the rest of the board into the PCB as part of a personal project.
                    I would use the hobbyist license for <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download" class="linked" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eagle</a> to design the PCB and <a href="https://oshpark.com/" class="linked" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OshPark</a> to fabricate it.
                </p>
                <li><h4>LabJack</h4>
                <p>The LabJack is a Data Acquisition device that allows one to interface with hardware using a computer.  They have libraries for common languages like Python
                 and C.  I've used the LabJack to read signals from 0-10V and 4-20mA hardware, thermocouples, flow meters, buttons, and custom leak detection rigs.  I've also used it to control 24V and 120V hardware
                including lights, solenoid valves, and relays.</p></li>

                <li><h4>Python</h4>
                <p>I've used Python to aid in engineering calculations, in reviewing test data, and in running programs with a Raspberry Pi and a Labjack as mentioned above.
